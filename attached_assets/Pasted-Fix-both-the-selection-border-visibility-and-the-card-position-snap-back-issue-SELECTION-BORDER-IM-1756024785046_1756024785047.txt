Fix both the selection border visibility and the card position snap-back issue.

SELECTION BORDER IMPROVEMENTS:

1. Bold Blue Border:
   - Selected cards: thick blue border (3-4px solid #3B82F6)
   - Border should be clearly visible against card background
   - Use box-shadow for additional emphasis: 0 0 0 3px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.3)
   - Ensure border doesn't affect card positioning or layout

2. Visual Contrast Enhancement:
   - Make sure blue border stands out against all card colors
   - Add subtle blue glow/shadow effect around selected cards
   - Maintain card content readability with strong border
   - Border should be visible on both light and dark themed cards

3. Selection State Styling:
   - Clear visual difference between selected and unselected states
   - Selected state should be immediately obvious to users
   - Smooth transition when selection changes (0.2s ease)
   - Border style should match the reference image provided

POSITION PERSISTENCE FIX:

4. Drag Position Bug Resolution:
   - Cards must stay in their new position after drag ends - no snap-back to original position
   - Update local state immediately when drag ends, before database call
   - Ensure position updates are committed to database successfully
   - Handle any database update failures gracefully without position revert

5. Position Update Logic:
   - On drag end: immediately update card position in UI state
   - Simultaneously save new position to database (canvas_x, canvas_y)
   - If database save fails, show error but keep new position in UI
   - Never revert to old position after successful drag operation

6. Debug Position Issues:
   - Add error handling for position updates
   - Ensure drag calculations are accurate relative to canvas
   - Verify position state management doesn't cause conflicts
   - Test that multiple rapid drags don't cause position confusion

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Bold, prominent blue selection border immediately visible
- Cards NEVER return to previous position after being dragged
- Position changes are permanent and persistent
- Smooth drag experience without position glitches

Fix both the visual selection feedback and the position snap-back problem.
