Add advanced canvas organization features: group clustering, dispersing, and fit-to-view functionality.

CANVAS ORGANIZATION BUTTONS:

1. Add Two Organization Buttons (below Groups in sidebar):
   - "Group Ideas" button - clusters cards by color/group
   - "Disperse Ideas" button - spreads out overlapping cards
   - Place these buttons in sidebar below the groups list

2. Group Ideas Functionality:
   - Cluster cards of same group/color together in visual stacks
   - Stack cards imperfectly (slight offsets) so users can see it's multiple cards
   - Each stack should show 3-5px offsets between cards to create "pile" effect
   - Keep stacks compact but visually clear that multiple cards exist
   - Maintain group color consistency in each cluster

3. Disperse Ideas Functionality:
   - Spread out all overlapping cards so none overlap
   - Keep cards of same group/color near each other (form loose zones)
   - Ensure every card is fully visible and readable
   - Create logical spacing between different group zones
   - Use intelligent positioning to avoid collisions

4. Dynamic Canvas with Fit-to-View:
   - Canvas should automatically expand to accommodate all cards
   - Add "Fit" button next to zoom controls (+ and - buttons)
   - Fit button calculates optimal zoom to show all cards in visible area
   - Display dynamic zoom percentage that updates when using fit
   - Both "Group Ideas" and "Disperse Ideas" should trigger automatic fit-to-view

5. Zoom Control Enhancements:
   - Show current zoom percentage (like "80%" in your image)
   - Fit button icon should be standard fit-to-view symbol
   - Smooth zoom transitions when using fit functionality
   - Preserve zoom controls while adding fit capability

6. Smart Positioning Algorithms:
   - Group Ideas: Calculate cluster centers, stack with offsets
   - Disperse: Use collision detection to prevent overlaps
   - Fit-to-View: Calculate bounding box of all cards, optimize zoom
   - Maintain card positions in database after organization

CRITICAL: The canvas should feel intelligent - automatically adapting to content and providing visual organization that scales with the number of ideas.
