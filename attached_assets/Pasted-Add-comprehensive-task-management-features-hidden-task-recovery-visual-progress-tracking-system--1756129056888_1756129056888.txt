Add comprehensive task management features: hidden task recovery + visual progress tracking system.

FEATURE 1: HIDDEN TASK RECOVERY

1. **Database Enhancement:**
   - Add "hidden" boolean field to tasks table (default: false)
   - Modify "Clear Completed": set hidden=true instead of deleting
   - Preserve all task data, relationships, and completion status when hidden

2. **Three-Dots Menu Logic:**
   - Show "Show Hidden Tasks (X)" ONLY when hidden tasks exist
   - Query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks WHERE todolist_id=? AND hidden=true`
   - Menu item disappears after restoration

3. **Restoration Functionality:**
   - Bulk restore: `UPDATE tasks SET hidden=false WHERE todolist_id=? AND hidden=true`
   - Tasks appear in original sections with original priority
   - Brief toast notification: "X tasks restored"

FEATURE 2: VISUAL PROGRESS TRACKING

4. **Progress Calculation Logic:**
   - Formula: (completed_tasks / total_visible_tasks) × 100
   - Exclude hidden tasks from calculation
   - Update progress in real-time when tasks completed/uncompleted
   - Round to nearest whole percentage

5. **Progress Bar Locations:**
SIDEBAR (Right):
2G                           [████████░░] 80%
0 of 5 completed
MODAL HEADER:
2G - TodoList               [████████░░] 80%
Show Priority: All

6. **Progress Bar Design:**
- Horizontal progress bar with percentage label
- Color coding: 0-33% (red), 34-66% (yellow), 67-100% (green)
- Smooth animation when progress changes
- Width: ~120px in sidebar, ~200px in modal

7. **Database Query for Progress:**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_tasks,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN completed = true THEN 1 END) as completed_tasks
FROM tasks 
WHERE todolist_id = ? AND hidden = false

Real-time Updates:

Progress updates immediately when checkbox clicked
Sidebar and modal sync automatically
Consider section-level progress bars as enhancement



INTEGRATION POINTS:

Progress calculation respects priority filters
Hidden tasks don't affect progress percentage
Restored tasks update progress immediately
Export functions include progress data in headers

This creates a comprehensive task management system with safety mechanisms and motivational progress feedback.
