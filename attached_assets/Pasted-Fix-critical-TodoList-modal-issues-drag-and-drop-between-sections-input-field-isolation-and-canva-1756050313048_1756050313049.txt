Fix critical TodoList modal issues: drag-and-drop between sections, input field isolation, and canvas synchronization.

TODOLIST MODAL FIXES:

1. Drag-and-Drop Between Sections:
   - Enable dragging tasks from one section to another
   - Visual feedback during drag (placeholder line, section highlighting)
   - Update task.section_id in database when dropped in new section
   - Smooth animations for task movement
   - Handle drag from "General Tasks" to custom sections and vice versa

2. Fix Input Field Isolation:
   - Each section's "Add a task..." input should be independent
   - Text typed in one section must not appear in other sections
   - Each input needs unique state management
   - Clear input after task creation in that specific section
   - Proper focus management between different section inputs

3. Canvas-TodoList Synchronization:
   - When task is created in TodoList modal, create corresponding idea card on canvas
   - Position new canvas card near other cards of the same group
   - New canvas card inherits group color and properties
   - Maintain idea_id â†” task relationship in database

4. Bi-directional Updates:
   - When canvas card is moved to different group, update corresponding task's section
   - When canvas card is deleted, remove corresponding task from TodoList
   - When task is deleted from TodoList, remove corresponding canvas card
   - Real-time updates between canvas and TodoList views

5. Database Operations:
   - INSERT ideas table when task created in TodoList
   - UPDATE tasks SET section_id WHERE id when dragged between sections
   - DELETE CASCADE operations to maintain data consistency
   - Proper foreign key relationships between ideas and tasks

6. UI State Management:
   - Refresh TodoList counts after changes
   - Update canvas immediately after TodoList changes
   - Handle concurrent edits gracefully
   - Show loading states during sync operations

CRITICAL: Tasks and canvas cards must stay perfectly synchronized. Changes in one view must immediately reflect in the other view with proper database persistence.
