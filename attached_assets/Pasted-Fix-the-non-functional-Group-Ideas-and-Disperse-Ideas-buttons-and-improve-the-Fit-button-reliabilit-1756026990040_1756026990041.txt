Fix the non-functional Group Ideas and Disperse Ideas buttons, and improve the Fit button reliability.

CANVAS ORGANIZATION FIXES:

1. Group Ideas Button Functionality:
   - When clicked, automatically cluster cards by group color
   - Stack cards of same group with slight offsets (3-5px) like in the reference image
   - Blue "Product Ideas" cards should cluster together as shown
   - Green "Marketing" cards cluster separately 
   - Maintain visual "pile" effect with overlapping but visible cards
   - Save new positions to database after grouping

2. Disperse Ideas Button Functionality:
   - Spread out ALL overlapping cards so none overlap
   - Keep cards of same color/group in nearby zones (loose clustering)
   - Ensure every card is fully readable and accessible
   - Use intelligent spacing algorithm to prevent collisions
   - Automatically trigger fit-to-view after dispersing
   - Save new positions to database after dispersing

3. Fit-to-View Button Reliability:
   - Calculate bounding box of ALL visible cards accurately
   - Add padding margin around card boundaries (50-100px)
   - Dynamically adjust zoom percentage to fit all content
   - Work consistently whether cards are grouped or dispersed
   - Update zoom percentage display in real-time
   - Handle edge cases (very few cards, very many cards)

4. Integrated Smooth Workflow:
   - Group Ideas → Auto fit-to-view
   - Disperse Ideas → Auto fit-to-view  
   - All operations should feel smooth and connected
   - Show loading state during position calculations if needed
   - Ensure database position updates don't cause visual glitches

5. Event Handler Debugging:
   - Verify button click events are properly attached
   - Add console logging to debug which functions are being called
   - Ensure functions aren't being blocked by other event handlers
   - Test that positioning algorithms actually execute

CRITICAL: The buttons must actually trigger their respective functions and produce the visual organization shown in the reference images.
