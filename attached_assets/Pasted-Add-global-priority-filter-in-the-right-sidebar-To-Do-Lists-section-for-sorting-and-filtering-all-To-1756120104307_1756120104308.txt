Add global priority filter in the right sidebar To-Do Lists section for sorting and filtering all TodoLists by task priorities.

CURRENT STATUS: ✅ 
- Priority filtering works inside individual TodoList modals
- Sidebar shows all TodoLists with task counts (e.g., "0 of 2 completed")

NEW REQUIREMENT:
Add a global priority filter at the top of the right sidebar that affects all visible TodoLists simultaneously.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

1. **Filter Position:**
   - Add filter above the "To-Do Lists" heading in right sidebar
   - Layout: "Filter by Priority: [All ▼]" aligned to the left

2. **Filter Options:**
   - "All" (default - shows all TodoLists normally)
   - "High Priority Tasks" (shows only TodoLists that contain priority 1 tasks)
   - "Medium Priority Tasks" (shows only TodoLists that contain priority 2 tasks)  
   - "Low Priority Tasks" (shows only TodoLists that contain priority 3 tasks)

3. **Filtering Logic:**
   - When filter is active, hide TodoLists that don't contain tasks of selected priority
   - Show task counts only for filtered priority level
   - Example: If "High Priority Tasks" selected, "2G" shows "0 of 1 completed" (only counting high priority tasks)
   - TodoLists with no tasks of selected priority should be hidden completely

4. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Clear indication when filter is active (not "All")
   - Update task counters to reflect filtered results
   - Smooth transitions when TodoLists appear/disappear

5. **Sorting Enhancement:**
   - When filter active, sort TodoLists by:
     * Most high-priority tasks first (when "High Priority Tasks" selected)
     * Highest concentration of selected priority level

VALIDATION TESTS:
- Select "High Priority Tasks" → only TodoLists containing priority 1 tasks visible
- Task counters show only high priority task progress  
- Select "All" → all TodoLists return to normal view
- Verify integration works with existing modal filters

This creates a powerful overview for focusing on priority-based work across all TodoLists.
